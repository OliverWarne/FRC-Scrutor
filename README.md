# Ugly-Scouting-Code
Hello! This is FRC Titan Robotics 5431 scouting code. When it's done, it *should* have 2 modes. 11st is the input where you either type in a teams stats (formatted how we do it), and then the 2nd mode where it analyzes the data and gives the teams a ranking. 

If you want to use this, don't. The earliest it'll be complete and usable by somebody who isn't looking at the code is 4/22/15.
